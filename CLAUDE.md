# Auto-Coding Framework

> Multi-role collaborative development framework based on Claude Code native Agent Teams + Anthropic's best practices for long-running agents.

## Overview

**Enable AI Agents to collaborate like a human team** — through clear role division, standardized workflows, and sustainable development of complex projects.

**Agent Teams TL;DR**
- Parallelizable work uses Agent Teams first, driven by `tasks.json` dependencies and `parallelGroups`.
- `project-manager` coordinates only; implementation stays with scoped subagents.
- Completion authority is single-sourced in `Feature Completion Checklist` from `.claude/rules/05-session-workflow.md`.

### Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **37 Specialized Agents** | Categorized: Development, Data, Security, Product, Documentation, Research |
| **8-Phase Development Process** | Requirements → Product → **UED (Stitch)** → Architecture → Breakdown → Development → Testing → Deployment → UAT |
| **Stitch Integration** | AI-powered UI/UX design via Google Stitch - generate visual prototypes, design systems, and component specs |
| **Dual-Track Task Management** | Native Agent Teams + Persistent Feature List (tasks.json) |
| **Cross-Session Context** | progress.txt records history, ensures long-cycle project continuity |

### Role Selection Guide

| Task | Choose |
|------|--------|
| Architecture design, tech selection | `architect` |
| Frontend UI development | `frontend-dev` |
| Backend API development | `backend-dev` |
| Data pipelines, ETL | `data-engineer` |
| Test case writing | `test-engineer` |
| Code review | `code-reviewer` |
| Requirements analysis, BRD | `business-analyst` |
| Product planning, PRD | `product-manager` |
| **Parallel task coordination** | `project-manager` (team-lead) |

## Quick Reference

### Agent Teams Core Principles ⚠️ MANDATORY

1. **Use Agent Teams for executable parallel work**
   - Start from `.auto-coding/tasks.json` (`parallelGroups` + dependencies).
   - Single-agent serial execution is valid only for inherently sequential tasks.

2. **Enforce strict team-lead boundary**
   - `project-manager` coordinates only: breakdown, assignment, tracking, blocker resolution, and acceptance verification.
   - `project-manager` must not write implementation code or bypass role separation.

3. **Follow parallel execution protocol**
   - Start subagents in background and isolate each in an independent tmux pane.
   - Coordinate dependencies through task status and messages.

4. **Treat subagents as temporary workers**
   - Spawn when ready, execute scoped work, report completion/blockers, exit after approval.
   - Never keep completed agents idle.

5. **Keep completion authority single-sourced**
   - Feature completion steps are defined only in `.claude/rules/05-session-workflow.md` under `Feature Completion Checklist`.

### Feature Completion Checklist ⚠️ MANDATORY

Every feature completion MUST follow these three steps in order:

```
1. Update tasks.json  →  passes: true, status: "completed"
2. Update progress.txt →  Append session record
3. Git commit          →  git commit -m "feat(FEAT-XXX): Description"
```

### Development Process

```
Phase 1: Requirements Analysis  →  BRD
Phase 2: Product Design         →  PRD
Phase 2.5: UI/UX Design (Stitch) →  DESIGN.md + Visual Prototypes + Component Specs
Phase 3: Architecture Design    →  Architecture Doc (must review)
Phase 4: Task Breakdown         →  tasks.json
Phase 5: Dev & Unit/Func Tests  →  Code + Tests (coverage policy in `.claude/rules/09-testing.md`)
Phase 6: Integration & Regress  →  E2E Tests
Phase 7: Deploy & UAT Loop      →  Production + Verification
Phase 8: PM Coordination        →  project-manager (team-lead)

```

Team-lead coordination context is always-on from Phase 1 to Phase 8 via `.claude/context/phase-manifest.json`.

### IMAC Command

Use `/IMAC` for iterative evolution of an existing project:

- Command file: `.claude/commands/IMAC.md`
- Meaning: **Install, Modify, And, Change**
- Default behavior:
  - Runs intake with single-select and multi-select questions when needed
  - Detects the correct restart phase automatically (Phase 1-5+)
  - Performs impact analysis across business/product/design/architecture/testing
  - Records change logs to `.auto-coding/progress.txt` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

### Stitch Design Workflow (Phase 2.5)

**Required Skills**: `ui-ux-pro-max` → `enhance-prompt` → `stitch-loop` → `design-md` → `shadcn-ui`

| Step                        | Skill             | Output                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Brainstorm Style & Theme | `ui-ux-pro-max` | Confirmed direction via multi-round user Q&A |
| 2. Enhance Prompt           | `enhance-prompt`  | `.stitch/next-prompt.md`                     |
| 3. Generate Design          | `stitch-loop`     | `.stitch/designs/{page}.html` + `.png`       |
| 4. Document System          | `design-md`       | `.stitch/DESIGN.md`                          |
| 5. Iterate Pages            | `stitch-loop`     | Additional pages via baton                   |
| 6. Component Spec           | `shadcn-ui`       | `docs/design/UI-SPEC-*.md`                   |

### Task ID Convention

`features[].id` must follow:

`{iteration}-{phaseSymbol}-{NNN}`

- `iteration`: `inital` or `imac-{abbr}`
- `phaseSymbol`: `p1r` `p1b` `p2p` `p25d` `p3a` `p4b` `p5d` `p6t` `p7d` `p8m`
- `NNN`: 3-digit sequence (`001`, `002`, ...)

---

## Language Requirements ⚠️ IMPORTANT

**All core framework files MUST be written in English**:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.auto-coding/` directory (tasks.json, progress.txt)
- `.claude/agents/*.md`
- `.claude/rules/*.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `.auto-coding/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`

**Exception**: User-facing documentation (BRD, PRD, etc.) can be in the project's primary language.
